# ROADMAP

We want to collect some basic information on the project's next steps.

## CURRENT

* We are creating a proper infrastructure to test the reliability of estimations using `soepy` and `estimagic` in a host of Monte Carlo exercises.

## UPCOMING

* start on exogenous fertility process and enforce explicit role for SOEP-IS data in construction of moments
