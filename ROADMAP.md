# ROADMAP

We want to collect some basic information on the project's next steps.

## CURRENT

* We are opening a new PR code_cleanup to address the issues collected in our Github [project 1](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/soepy/projects/1).
* We are working on the SMM interface at Boryana's [repo](https://github.com/boryana-ilieva/smm_soepy) which will provide the adapter classes for the SMM estimation that we want to integrate into the package itself.

## UPCOMING

* We need to address performance issues by working with NUMBA.
