In our loop we want to take into account the fact that, in the first period at age 16, only individuals who have completed 10 years of education (assuming education for everyone starts at the age of 6) will be making a labor market choice between full-time (F), part-time (P), and non-employment (N).

Since one of the state space components is a lagged value - choice_lagged - there is no value one can assign to this state space component in the first period. As individuals make their first choice in the first period there is no prior choice one can record as choice_lagged at the very beginning of the model.\n",
