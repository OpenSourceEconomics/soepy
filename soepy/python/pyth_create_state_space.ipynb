In our loop we want to take into account the fact that, in the first period at age 16, only individuals who have completed 10 years of education (assuming education for everyone starts at the age of 6) will be making a labor market choice between full-time (F), part-time (P), and non-employment. The remaining individuals are still in education, such that a state space point where years of education equal e.g. 11 and a labor market choice of e.g. part-time is observed is not admissible and should therefore not be recorded.
