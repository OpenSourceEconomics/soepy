As a reminder, we note that we model individuals from age 16 (legally binding mininum level of education) until age 60 (typical retirement entry age), i.e., for 45 periods, where the 1st period corresponds to age 16, the second period to age 17, etc. The current specification of starting values is equivalent to the observation / simulated reality that individuals in the sample have completed something between 10 and 14 years of edcuation. In our loop we want to take into account the fact that, in the first period at age 16, only individuals who have completed 10 years of education (assuming education for everyone starts at the age of 6) will be making a labor market choice between full-time (F), part-time (P), and non-employment (N). The remaining individuals are still in education, such that a state space point where years of education equal e.g. 11 and a labor market choice of e.g. part-time is observed is not admissible and should therefore not be recorded. This is ensured by the if clause \"educ_years > period\".\n",

In order to later be able to compute the instataneous utility for this individuals, we need to record their state space components. As there is no lagged choice available to record, we force set the lagged choice component to zero. In particular, for states for which the condition (period == educ_years) is true, i.e., for individuals who have just entered the model, we record a state: (educ_years + educ_min, 0, 0, 0)."
