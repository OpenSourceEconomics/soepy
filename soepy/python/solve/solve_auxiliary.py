def pyth_create_state_space(model_params):
    """Create state space object.

    The state space consists of all admissible combinations of the following components:
    period, years of education, lagged choice, full-time experience (F),
    and part-time experience (P).

    :data:`states` stores the information on states in a tabular format.
    Each row of the table corresponds to one admissible state space point
    and contains the values of the state space components listed above.
    :data:`indexer` is a multidimensional array where each component
    of the state space corresponds to one dimension. The values of the array cells
    index the corresponding state space point in :data:`states`.
    Traversing the state space requires incrementing the indices of :data:`indexer`
    and selecting the corresponding state space point component values in :data:`states`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model_params: namedtuple
        Namedtuple containing all information relevant for running a simulation.
        Includes parameters, dimensions, information on initial conditions, etc.

    Returns
    -------
    states : np.ndarray
        Array with shape (num_states, 5) containing period, years of schooling,
        the lagged choice, the years of experience in part-time, and the
        years of experience in full-time employment.
    indexer : np.ndarray
        A matrix where each dimension represents a characteristic of the state space.
        Switching from one state is possible via incrementing appropriate indices by 1.
