This is necessary for computing the continuation values and, ultimately, the value functions and the model's solution. Integating out the error term represents the process in which individuals in the model form expectations about the future. Assuming rational expectations and a known error term distribution up to its parameters, individuals take the possible realization of the error terms into account by computing the expected continuation values over the distribution of the errors. For every period we simmulate num_draws_emax draws from the error term distribution. This has been done in the backward induction procedure.\n",
