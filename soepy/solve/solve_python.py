    """Solve the model by backward induction.

    The solution routine performs four key operations:
    - create all nodes (state space points) of the decision tree (state space)
    that the agents might possibly reach.
    - create covariates that depend on the state space components at every
    state space point.
    - calculate the instantaneous/flow utilities for each possible choice at every
    state space point
    - calculate the continuation values for each choice at every
    state space point.

    Parameters
    __________
    model_params : namedtuple
        Namedtuple containing all structural, potentially free and estimable,
        parameters relevant for running a simulation.
    model_spec : namedtuple
        Namedtuple containing all fixed parameters relevant for running a simulation
    is_expected: bool
        A boolean indicator that differentiates between the human capital accumulation
        process that agents expect (is_expected = True) and that the market generates
        (is_expected = False)

    Returns
    _______
    states : np.ndarray
        Array with shape (num_states, 5) containing period, years of schooling,
        the lagged choice, the years of experience in part-time, and the
        years of experience in full-time employment.
    indexer : np.ndarray
        A matrix where each dimension represents a characteristic of the state space.
        Switching from one state is possible via incrementing appropriate indices by 1.
    covariates : np.ndarray
        Array with shape (num_states, number of covariates) containing all additional
        covariates, which depend only on the state space information.
    emaxs : np.ndarray
        Array with shape (num states, num_choices +1). First block of dimension
        num_choices contains continuation values of the state space point.
        Lat element contains the expected maximum value function of the state space point.
