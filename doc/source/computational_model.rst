Computational Model
===================

This part of the documentation specifies the functional forms, types of shocks and exogenous processes we bring together with the developed economic model to perform simulation and estimation. We discusses the functional form of the utility function, the laws of motion for the agents' budget constraints, the chosen formulation of the wage and the experience accumulation processes, as well as many more in greater detail.
